This link also mentioned that there is a password cracker called `John the Ripper` that could be used to crack the `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/shadow`

```console
scp -P 4242 level01@<snow_crash_ip>:/etc/passwd .

First we need to get the `CONTAINER ID` from docker with this command
```console
docker ps

Next we can copy the file into docker with this command
```console
docker cp <src-path> <container_id>:<dest-path> 
```

Finally use `John the Ripper` to crack the `passwd` that we have just copied into the docker
```console
john --show <file-path>
```
